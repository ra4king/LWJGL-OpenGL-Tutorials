# README #

## Quick Start ##

### What you need ###

* Java Development Kit for Java 7 ([get it here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html))

* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org) available in your PATH

* An IDE like [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org), [IntelliJ](http://jetbrains.com/idea), or [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org)

* Support for Maven in your IDE (Eclipse Juno and IntelliJ both come with maven support)

* _Optional, for Windows users:_ a version of the bash shell (either [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com)
  or [Git Bash](https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash) are fine)

### How to run samples ###

1. Ensure you have Java SDK 7 and maven installed and both are in your PATH
2. Clone this repository: `hg clone https://bitbucket.org/ra4king/lwjgl-shader-tutorials`
3. Open a bash window and cd where you cloned this repository
4. Start the launcher: `./launch`

## Sections ##

Every section is found in the source under `src/main/java/com/ra4king/opengl`.
Under each section you can find another README file that gives more detail, and finally some of the samples themselves may have their own README.


* **arcsynthesis:** The excellent C tutorials from "Learning Modern 3d Graphics Programming"
at [arcsynthesis.org](http://arcsynthesis.org/gltut)


* **redbook:** A collection of examples from the [OpenGL Programming Guide](http://www.glprogramming.com/red/) first edition
 (warning: uses _very_ obsolete OpenGL)


* **superbible:** A collection of examples from the [OpenGL SuperBible](http://www.starstonesoftware.com/OpenGL/) fourth edition
(Also old-fashioned in parts, but fifth edition examples are coming soon!)
